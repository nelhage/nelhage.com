*** Running the exploits ***

You'll need to disable address-space randomization in order to get
hackit.pl or hackit-noexec.pl to work. On Linux, you can do this with

$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

as root.

If you're using gcc 4.1 or newer, you'll need to build with
-fno-stack-protector to disable stack protection. You may also need -z
execstack for hackit.pl to work.

The `system' address is pre-computed for my libc and kernel; You'll
need to recalculate it using gdb as explained in the slides in order
to get hackit-noexec or hackit-aslr to work.

The stack offsets used here work on my machine. I would expect them to
work on other machines, but since some of the stack space is set up by
the kernel before program execution, you may need to change them for a
different kernel.

Enjoy!
